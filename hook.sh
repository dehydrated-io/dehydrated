    # validated, including any alternative names you may have listed.
    #
    # Parameters:
    # - DOMAIN
    #   The domain name (CN or subject alternative name) being
    #   validated.
    # - TOKEN_FILENAME
    #   The name of the file containing the token to be served for HTTP
    #   validation. Should be served by your web server as
    #   /.well-known/acme-challenge/${TOKEN_FILENAME}.
    # - TOKEN_VALUE
    #   The token value that needs to be served for validation. For DNS
    #   validation, this is what you want to put in the _acme-challenge
    #   TXT record. For HTTP validation it is the value that is expected
    #   be found in the $TOKEN_FILENAME file.

    # This hook is called once for each certificate that has been

    # to service-specific locations and reload the service.
    #
    # Parameters:
    # - DOMAIN
    #   The primary domain name, i.e. the certificate common
    #   name (CN).
    # - KEYFILE
    #   The path of the file containing the private key.
    # - CERTFILE
    #   The path of the file containing the signed certificate.
    # - CHAINFILE
    #   The path of the file containing the full certificate chain.
